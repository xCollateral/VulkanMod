## Issues

Before asking for help, if your instance is crashing check if your system supports Vulkan and if any of the mods listed in the link below is present in your instance.

Please before reporting any issue check if there is another one similar already opened.

## Compatibility

Mod compatibility is not guaranteed. When VulkanMod is loaded, mods that make explicit calls to OpenGL will crash the game.
Check [Incompatible mods](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/discussions/226) list to make sure you are not using one of them.

## Known Issues

- Linux and macOS may not work properly or not at all.

### Notes
This is still alpha mod. Bugs are to be expected.
